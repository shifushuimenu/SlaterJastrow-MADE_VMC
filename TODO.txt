[ ] When computing the local energy, the ratio of amplitudes for two very similar states is required,
    which differ only by one electron position. Still, both configurations must be passed through 
    the neural network. This is the 4fficiency bottleneck. Is it possible to evaluate only part of the 
    neural network ? Is it possible to take the gradient wth respect to the inputs and then calculate 
    the change in the probability amplitude given the small change in the input (just one position) ?
